## Mimblewimble

On Mon Aug 01 2016 a user named majorplayer logged into the #bitcoin-wizards IRC channel, dropped a text file hosted on a Tor server and then disappeared. The document was titled MIMBLEWIMBLE and authored under the pseudonym Tom Elvis Jedusor. It described a protocol which is both private and extremely lightweight.

`-!- majorplayer [...] has joined #bitcoin-wizards`

`|majorplayer| hi, i have an idea for improving privacy in bitcoin. my friend who knows technology says this channel would have interest http://5pdcbgndmprm4wud.onion/mimblewimble.txt`

`-!- majorplayer [...] has quit [Client Quit]`

The following day, users `nsh` and `andytoshi` (Andrew Poelstra) began discussing the idea proposed in the paper. The anonymous writer left several un-answered questions in the document, along with a general lack of details, so there was much to discuss. The conversation included a memorable moment:

`|nsh| gotta be some way this is sneaky, otherwise it's too good to be true...`

`|andytoshi| hah, yeah, i know the feeling`

On Oct 10 2016, Andrew Poelstra published a follow-up paper about Mimblewimble, which introduced several refinements to the original proposal and describes further its technical details.
